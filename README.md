# EpicReactNotes
My personal notes taken while studing on [EpicReact](epicreact.dev)

Those notes are taken with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a tool to develop your second brain that I advice you to use every day but since Obsidian creates **Markdown files** you do not need to use it to read my notes, you'll miss the internal linking and graph generating feature but you'll be able to access the content no matter what.

Hope you'll find this notes as useful as been to me writing those.
